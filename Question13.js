// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

const car = ["Honda", "Mercedez", "Toyota", "KIA"];

console.log("I would like to own a " + car[0] + " car");
console.log("I would love to drive a " + car[1] + " Benz");
console.log(car[2] + " is the most affordable car");
console.log(car[3] + " has had a good response by customers");
