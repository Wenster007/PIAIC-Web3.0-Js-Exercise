// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let friends = ["Hassan", "Sameer", "Muhib", "Farhan"];

for (var i=0; i<friends.length; i++){
    console.log(`${friends[i]}, Its good to see you again`);
}
