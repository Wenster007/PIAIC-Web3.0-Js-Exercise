// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guestList = ["Ahmed", "Talha", "Hashir", "Zeeshan"];

for (var i=0; i<guestList.length; i++){
    console.log(guestList[i] + " You are invited for Dinner on this Friday.");
}

console.log(guestList[1] + " can not attend the Dinner");
